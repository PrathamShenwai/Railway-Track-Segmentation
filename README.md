# Railway Track Segmentation using U-Net

This repository contains the code and resources for railway track segmentation using the U-Net architecture. The U-Net is a popular convolutional neural network model that is widely used for image segmentation tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the RailSem19 Railway Track Segmentation Dataset. It consists of high-resolution images of railway tracks along with corresponding pixel-level annotations indicating the presence or absence of tracks. The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://wilddash.cc/railsem19).

### The repository contains trained model of U-Net in different deployable formats.

--> run the live.py script to view the inference through webcam.
--> run the video.py script to view the model inference on video.
--> Jupyter notebook contains the training code.
